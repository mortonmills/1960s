//script generation, easier to manage by converting csv data into js object then generate webpage, structured content through names of objects
//JSON vs YAML for nested values


//use browser, office apps, and html when possible for productivity tools
//use html, browser, or office apps for development, ex google spreadsheets for code organization

//use single quotes for mass strings of document

//variable definition for scripts seperate from execution
