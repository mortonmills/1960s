MAINTENANCE
Possibility Space

values can change depending on the conditions

general likelihood


MAINTENANCE
analogy to images

sculpting data, start with large chunks first, similar to artists in drawing with larger parts first

dithering, contrast of data points in range, can smooth with fuzzy data point at edge, impressionism

conditional data points and range




MAINTENANCE
maintenance is to rebuild contrary to the natural condition. The greater the difference the faster the decay.

Possibility space

Probability space interpreting the value of possibility, act according to new information but common streams



POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL
Potential actual actualizer

nouns and verbs

goods and services 

good technique 

series of conditions/states/goods

fighting a natural condition, greater opposition, greater maintenance required

can be created through understanding the mechanics

tool/technique layer

possibility space or range



MAINTENANCE
Analogy types

fruits/food/milkshake

animals

weapons

cars



MAINTENANCE
Problems with English language

No letter C, k and s do the same

no capital letters, have a symbol at front of word, $adam

also takes up unnecessary space in ASCII
