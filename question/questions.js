POSSIBILITY SPACE, RANGE: Use all possible outcomes,generate possibility space and resolution, parameters
PROBABILITY SPACE, RANGE: interpreting the value of possibility, act according to new information but common streams
	Next step is Filter and byproducts, rule creation, restrictions, what can and cannot be, parameters
	also conditional changes

]
body, mind, spirit/efficient, soul, 
Potential/capable, service, power source, and goal/motive
condition-maker => must continually maintain the condition, greater difference, greater decay rate

fighting a natural condition, greater opposition, greater maintenance required
