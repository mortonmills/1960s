INTRO
 GOAL/CONDITION DEFINITION
 BREAKING INTO TRANSFORMATIONS/TASKS,SUBTASKS,MILESTONES,	series of conditions/states/goods
 RESEARCH mechanics science
	POSSIBILITY SPACE, RANGE: Use all possible outcomes, generate possibility space and resolution, parameters, variables
	PROBABILITY SPACE, RANGE: interpreting the value of possibility, act according to new information but common streams
		Next step is Filter and byproducts, rule creation, restrictions, what can and cannot be, parameters
		also conditional changes
 DESIGN control flow, to condition
 GATHER tools suppliers, storage and transport/using frameworks or building from scratch, that is low vs high level
 BUILD
	TRANSFORMATIONS, CHANGE
	 => goal/condition to meet, break down into sub goals milestones
	let relationship = [
	material, information, energy,
	ingredients, recipe, work, result (tools that form content vs the content itself)
	objects/data, functions, processing, return value
	nouns/assets, verbs/act, actor, 
	goods, services, servicer, condition
	tools, techniques, energy/effort, goal
	body, mind, spirit/efficient, soul, 
	potientalizer => Potential => actual => actualizer/potentializer
	tool-maker => tool => technique => techniquer
	knife-maker, knife, slice, chef/slicer
	sword-maker, sword, swording, swordsmen,  
	]
	condition-maker => must continually maintain the condition, greater difference, greater decay rate
	maintenance is to rebuild contrary to the natural condition. The greater the difference the faster the decay.
	fighting a natural condition, greater opposition, greater maintenance required
